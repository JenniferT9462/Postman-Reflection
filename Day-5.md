  ## Reflection

  I think I like Thunder Client better. Mainly for the user interface. It is so easy to use and I like how the request response comes up on the side in a much larger window. I have trouble with Postman when setting up the windows. I really like that Thunder client is inside of VSCode it's very convenient. Overall, I feel like they operate pretty much the same.
